			<h4>WHY CHOOSE US</h4>
			<h5>Because We are Reliable</h5>
			<p> In the event that you hate technology and prefer to stay off the Internet and away from major news sites, you may not have heard that Apple went into beastmode this week. </p>

			<p>Powered by massive sales of the iPhone 6, the tech giant broke their own records and more on Tuesday, bumping their revenue up by $74.6 billion. Apple sold 74.5 million iPhones in its first fiscal quarter, which ended Dec. 27, putting profits at $18 billion—the biggest ever for a public company, and an increase from $13.1 billion from the year before. Interestingly, a lot of this success has been attributed to Android users switching to the iPhone.  </p>

			<p>More interesting still is that this is happening as many people with Androids and other phones keep rallying against Apple hard as ever. And there is precedent for their righteous anger, too. Other phones are not only debatably more cost effective, but routinely ranked ahead of the iPhone.The potential for Apple to control of your entire being has now become almost frighteningly endless. Even the “ugly duckling” of the family, the Apple TV, possesses plenty of untapped potential. But since we’ve culturally shifted towards a place where we no longer see our phones as a luxury, but as a necessity, doesn’t it make sense that they would use the iPhone as a window into world domination? And really, since iPhone users seem to be content with having Apple dominate their lives anyway, this shouldn’t come as a big surprise.  </p>

			<p>Upgrades, on any good phone, are a necessity. The difference is that with Apple, the ecosystem of your iPhone can easily become intrinsic to the ecosystem that dominates the rest of your digital life. “It seems fair to say that many iPhone fans are equally devoted to the rest of the Apple line too,” writes Elgan. Does this make diversifying your technological options easy? No, but again, that’s the point. He continues, “Many Android users enjoy customization and see that option as one of the main draws of Google’s operating system. They believe that iPhone users choose a phone that can’t easily be modified because they have no interest in tinkering with their phones—and may even grow anxious at the prospect of customizability.”  </p>

			<p>Still, you have to give it to Apple for getting there first. We beat the Soviet Union to the moon, and look how that worked out. “There was pent-up demand for a smartphone with an app ecosystem before either iOS or Android, but Apple shipped first,” writes Elgan. “People rushed to buy the iPhone, then stuck with it because they invested in apps.” </p>

			<h4>OUR MISSION</h4>
			<h5>To Refine your Brand</h5>
		<p> It’s hard to deny that Apple products look pretty great. The iPhone still has the most singular look of any smartphone out there, after a multitude of upgrades and changes. And of course, the beautiful design of the iPhone is, by design, meant to be beautiful. Mike Elgan of Computer World notes that the iPhone “has flawless ‘fit and finish’ and is made with incredibly high-quality materials.” </p>

Apple controls all things Apple, and looking to the future, they appear more poised than ever to control your whole life, too. “Apple’s message this week was loud and clear: Forget everything you thought you knew about the iPhone maker or its mobile products,” stated ReadWrite’s Adrianna Lee on the week the company released the iPhone 6. “The plan: Reboot the iPhone product line as a beautiful phablet line, give the larger flagship an even bigger premium sibling, introduce Apple’s first-ever smartwatch, and tackle brand-new categories—from health and fitness to mobile payments.”
